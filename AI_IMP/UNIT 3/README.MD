Perfect ‚Äî since you only need to **attempt either Q1 or Q2**, here are the **2 most high-frequency and safest topic groups** to study so you're well-covered **regardless of the variation** in this year‚Äôs exam.

---

## ‚úÖ **Safe Group 1: Adversarial Search + Constraint Satisfaction (Cryptarithmetic)**

This group has appeared together **3 times** in Q1/Q2 from 2022‚Äì2024.

### üîπ Prepare:

1. **Minimax Algorithm** (with tree diagram & evaluation)
2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning** (with pruning steps and efficiency)
3. **Cryptarithmetic Problem Solving**

   * e.g., `SEND + MORE = MONEY`, `BASE + BALL = GAMES`
4. **Types of CSP consistencies** (node, arc, path ‚Äì just in case)

---

## ‚úÖ **Safe Group 2: Backtracking (N-Queen) + Game Theory or MCTS**

This group covers the other variation when CSP is secondary.

### üîπ Prepare:

1. **Backtracking with N-Queen Problem**

   * Algorithm + Diagram
2. **Game Theory Concepts**

   * Deterministic vs Stochastic
   * Partial vs Complete games
3. **Monte Carlo Tree Search** *(if asked instead of Game Theory)*

   * Steps + Example

---

## üîê **Why These 2 Groups?**

| **Topic Group**                 | **Coverage**    | **Years Asked Together** |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Minimax + Cryptarithmetic (CSP) | Very High (80%) | 2022, 2023, 2024         |
| N-Queen + Game Theory / MCTS    | High (70%)      | 2022 (Q2), 2023, 2024    |

So, if you **master these two groups**, **you'll be safe** regardless of whether they ask:

* Q1: Search-heavy with adversarial focus
* Q2: CSP-heavy with backtracking or MCTS

Here‚Äôs a **mock Q1/Q2 set for the 2025 SPPU AI (310253) exam** based on the latest patterns, expected topics, and variations ‚Äî along with **model answers and diagrams**.

---

## üìù **Mock Question 1 \[2025 Prediction]**

### **Q1) a) Explain Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning with suitable example and diagram. \[9 marks]**

### **Q1) b) Solve the following Cryptarithmetic problem using CSP techniques:**

### ¬†¬†¬†¬†**SEND + MORE = MONEY**

**Explain steps clearly. \[9 marks]**

---

## ‚úÖ **Model Answer: Q1a**

### **Minimax Algorithm**

Minimax is a recursive decision-making algorithm used in **adversarial games**. It assumes:

* **Two players**: MAX (tries to maximize score) and MIN (tries to minimize it).
* Complete game tree is evaluated up to terminal states.

---

### **Alpha-Beta Pruning**

It **optimizes Minimax** by eliminating branches that don‚Äôt affect the final decision.

#### **Alpha (Œ±)**: Best value that MAX can guarantee.

#### **Beta (Œ≤)**: Best value that MIN can guarantee.

### **Diagram:**

```
             MAX
           /     \
         MIN      MIN
        /  \      /  \
      MAX MAX   MAX  MAX
     / \  / \   / \   / \
     3  5 6  9  1  2  0  -1
```

### **Pruning Example**

(Alpha-beta removes the need to explore paths that can‚Äôt influence the final decision.)

---

### **Steps of Alpha-Beta Pruning**

1. Traverse tree in depth-first manner.
2. At each MAX node, update Œ± = max(Œ±, value).
3. At each MIN node, update Œ≤ = min(Œ≤, value).
4. **If Œ± ‚â• Œ≤ at any node ‚Üí prune**.

### **Advantages:**

* Reduces time complexity from O(b^d) to O(b^(d/2)) in best case.

---

## ‚úÖ **Model Answer: Q1b**

### **SEND + MORE = MONEY**

We assign a unique digit (0‚Äì9) to each letter so the equation holds true.
All digits must be **distinct**, and no number can start with 0.

### **Step 1: Variables**

Letters: S, E, N, D, M, O, R, Y

### **Step 2: Domains**

* Each variable ‚àà {0, 1, ..., 9}
* S and M ‚â† 0

### **Step 3: Constraint Equation**

```
  S E N D
+ M O R E
---------
M O N E Y
```

### **Step 4: Apply Backtracking + Forward Checking**

Using CSP techniques (domain reduction and arc consistency), we deduce a valid assignment:

‚úÖ **Solution:**

```
  9 5 6 7
+ 1 0 8 5
---------
1 0 6 5 2
```

### **Letter Assignments:**

S=9, E=5, N=6, D=7, M=1, O=0, R=8, Y=2

‚úîÔ∏è Equation holds:

```
9567 + 1085 = 10652
```

**Goal**: Place 4 queens on a 4x4 board such that no two queens attack each other.

### **Backtracking Approach:**

* Place queen in one column of a row.
* If conflict, backtrack and try next column.

### **State Tree (Partial):**

```
Row 0: Q at (0, 0)
‚Üí Row 1: Try (1, 2)
‚Üí Row 2: Try (2, 3)
‚Üí Row 3: Try (3, 1) ‚Üí ‚úÖ Success!

## ‚úÖ **Model Answer: Q2b**

### **Minimax vs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**

| Feature           | Minimax                   | MCTS                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Based on          | Full tree evaluation      | Random simulations (playouts)     |
| Use case          | Perfect information games | Large/complex or stochastic games |
| Heuristic needed? | Yes                       | No                                |
| Efficiency        | Prunes with alpha-beta    | Focuses on promising branches     |

---

### **Steps of MCTS:**

1. **Selection** ‚Äì Traverse tree using UCB1 to select node.
2. **Expansion** ‚Äì Expand one of the unexplored child nodes.
3. **Simulation** ‚Äì Perform random simulation from new node.
4. **Backpropagation** ‚Äì Update statistics (wins, visits).

---

### **Example**: Used in **Go, Chess, or 2048**

* Instead of evaluating all moves, it simulates thousands of games.
* Learns from best outcomes and focuses search.
