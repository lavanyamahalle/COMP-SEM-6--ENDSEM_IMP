## ‚úÖ **Answer 7a: Goal Stack Planning (STRIPS)**

### üîπ **STRIPS** ‚Äì Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver

Used in **goal-based planning**, where:

* Goals are represented as a stack
* Actions are applied in reverse (top-down)
* Preconditions are satisfied recursively

---

### üîÅ **Example: Make tea**

**Goal:** Have tea

**Initial State:**

* Kettle is empty
* No water in cup
* Tea bag is available

**Operators:**

| Action    | Preconditions         | Add List    | Delete List   |
| --------- | --------------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| BoilWater | WaterInKettle         | HotWater    | WaterInKettle |
| AddTeaBag | EmptyCup              | TeaBagInCup | EmptyCup      |
| PourWater | HotWater, TeaBagInCup | TeaReady    | HotWater      |

| Reusability      | High (domain-specific planning strategies) | Low (generally single-use search trees) |
| Involves Actions | Yes (defined using operators like STRIPS)  | Often just path from state to goal      |
| Example          | Robot cooking a meal                       | Pathfinding in a maze                   |
