Here’s a carefully crafted **predicted Q5 and Q6 for 2025** (SPPU AI – 310253) based on analysis from 2022–2024 papers. This includes **model answers** with **diagrams** and formatted explanations.

# ✅ **Predicted Q5 (2025)**

### **Q5)**

**a)** Explain Forward Chaining and Backward Chaining. Mention their properties, advantages, and disadvantages. \[9]
**b)**
i) Explain Unification in FOL. Solve stepwise with proper comments:
    `p(x, g(x)) =? p(g(y), g(z))`
ii) What is reasoning with default information? \[8]

---

## ✅ **Answer 5a)**

### 🔹 **Forward Chaining:**

* Data-driven reasoning.
* Starts from **known facts** and applies rules to derive new facts until the goal is reached.

#### 🔁 **Diagram:**

```
Facts → Rule 1 → New Fact → Rule 2 → Goal
```

### **Example:**

Given:

1. `A → B`
2. `B → C`
3. `A`

Using Forward Chaining:

* From A → derive B → then derive C.

---

### 🔹 **Backward Chaining:**

* Goal-driven reasoning.
* Starts from the **goal** and works backward to see if known facts support it.

#### 🔁 **Diagram:**

```
Goal ← Rule ← Subgoal ← Known Facts
```

### **Example:**

To prove `C`, check `B → C`, then check if `A → B` and `A` are known.

---

### 🔹 **Comparison Table:**

| Feature      | Forward Chaining               | Backward Chaining            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Direction    | Data → Goal                    | Goal → Data                  |
| Useful for   | All possible conclusions       | Specific goal proving        |
| Efficiency   | May explore irrelevant facts   | Efficient for single goals   |
| Disadvantage | Inefficient for specific goals | May loop if not handled well |

## ✅ **Answer 5b(i): Unification**

### 🔹 **Unification** is the process of making two logical expressions identical by finding a substitution.

#### **Problem:**

`p(x, g(x)) =? p(g(y), g(z))`

#### **Step-by-Step:**

1. Compare outer predicates: `p = p` ✅
2. Compare first arguments: `x = g(y)` → substitute `x ← g(y)`
3. Apply substitution: `g(x)` becomes `g(g(y))`
4. Compare second arguments: `g(g(y)) = g(z)` → so `z ← g(y)`

#### ✅ **Unifier:**

`{ x ← g(y), z ← g(y) }`

---

## ✅ **Answer 5b(ii): Reasoning with Default Information**

* **Default reasoning** is used when **complete information is not available**.
* Uses **assumptions** (defaults) until contradicted.

### **Example:**

> “Birds can fly” is a default. But if you later learn Tweety is a penguin, the assumption is retracted.

* Handled using **non-monotonic logic** (truth values can change with new information).

---

# ✅ **Predicted Q6 (2025)**

### **Q6)**

**a)** Explain Backward Chaining with an example. \[8]
**b)** What is Ontological Engineering? Explain in detail with its categories: object and model. \[9]

---

## ✅ **Answer 6a)**

### 🔁 **See Q5a above for core Backward Chaining details**

#### 🔹 **Example:**

Rules:

1. `A ∧ B → C`
2. `C → D`
   Facts: `A`, `B`

**Goal:** Prove `D`

**Steps:**

* To prove `D`, check `C → D`
* To get `C`, check if `A ∧ B → C` is satisfied
* Since `A` and `B` are known, derive `C`
* Then derive `D`

---

## ✅ **Answer 6b): Ontological Engineering**

### 🔹 **Definition:**

Ontological engineering deals with designing structured frameworks (ontologies) that define the **types, properties, and relationships** of entities in a particular domain.

---

### 🔹 **Ontology = Vocabulary + Relationships + Rules**

#### 🧱 **Categories of Ontology:**

1. **Object Ontology:**

   * Represents **real-world entities**: Car, Person, Building.
   * Defines attributes and relationships between objects.

2. **Model Ontology:**

   * Describes the **knowledge and reasoning process**.
   * Includes rules, constraints, and logical structures.

---

### 🔁 **Diagram: Ontological Layer**

```
+-------------------------+
| Model Ontology          | ← logic, rules, reasoning
+-------------------------+
| Object Ontology         | ← real-world objects/entities
+-------------------------+
| Domain Knowledge Layer  |
+-------------------------+
