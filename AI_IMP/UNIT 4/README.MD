# ✅ **Model Question 3 (Likely this year)**

## **Q3)**

**a)** What is an Agent? Name any 5 agents around you. Explain Knowledge-Based Agent with Wumpus World. \[9]
**b)** Represent the following axioms in Predicate Logic: \[9]
i) If a triangle is equilateral then it is isosceles.
ii) If a triangle is isosceles, then its two sides AB and AC are equal.
iii) If AB and AC are equal, then angle B and C are equal.
iv) ABC is an equilateral triangle.

---

## ✅ **Answer 3a)**

### 🔹 **Definition of Agent:**

An **agent** is anything that can perceive its environment through **sensors** and act upon that environment through **actuators**.

### 🔹 **5 Examples of Agents Around You:**

1. Smart thermostat
2. Google Assistant
3. Roomba vacuum cleaner
4. Self-driving car
5. ATM

---

### 🔹 **Knowledge-Based Agent:**

A **knowledge-based agent** uses **internal knowledge** to make decisions. It includes:

* Knowledge base (facts, rules)
* Inference engine (logic + reasoning)
* Perception & Action capabilities

---

### 🔹 **Wumpus World Example**

#### **PEAS:**

| Component   | Description                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| Performance | Gold collected, safe path       |
| Environment | Grid world with pits and Wumpus |
| Actuators   | Move, Turn, Grab, Shoot         |
| Sensors     | Breeze, Stench, Glitter, Bump   |

#### 🔽 Diagram of Wumpus World Agent:

```
 +-------------------------------+
 |           Agent               |
 | +-------------------------+   |
 | | Knowledge Base          |   |
 | | Inference Engine        |   |
 | +-------------------------+   |
 |   ↓ Sensors        ↑ Actions  |
 +-------------------------------+
        ↕ interacts with
      Wumpus Grid Environment
```

Agent senses **breeze or stench**, infers possible Wumpus or pit, updates KB, and acts accordingly.

## ✅ **Answer 3b)**

### 🔹 FOL Conversion:

Let:

* `Equilateral(x)` = x is equilateral
* `Isosceles(x)` = x is isosceles
* `Equal(AB, AC)` = sides AB and AC are equal
* `Equal(∠B, ∠C)` = angles B and C are equal
* `Triangle(x)` = x is a triangle

1. `∀x(Equilateral(x) → Isosceles(x))`
2. `∀x(Isosceles(x) → Equal(AB, AC))`
3. `Equal(AB, AC) → Equal(∠B, ∠C)`
4. `Equilateral(ABC)`

---

# ✅ **Model Question 4 (Likely this year)**

## **Q4)**

**a)** Write the following sentences in FOL using appropriate quantifiers: \[9]
i) All birds fly.
ii) Some boys play cricket.
iii) A first cousin is a child of a parent's sibling.
iv) You can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time, but not all the people all the time.

**b)** What is Knowledge Representation using Propositional Logic? Compare Propositional and Predicate Logic. \[9]

---

## ✅ **Answer 4a)**

Let:

* `Bird(x)`, `Flies(x)`
* `Boy(x)`, `Plays(x, Cricket)`
* `Cousin(x, y)`, `Child(x, z)`, `Sibling(z, w)`, `Parent(y, w)`
* `Fool(x, y, t)` — x can fool y at time t

1. `∀x(Bird(x) → Flies(x))`
2. `∃x(Boy(x) ∧ Plays(x, Cricket))`
3. `∀x∀y(Cousin(x, y) ↔ ∃z∃w(Parent(w, y) ∧ Sibling(z, w) ∧ Child(x, z)))`
4. `∀x∃t1(Fool(x, AllPeople, t1)) ∧ ∃x∀t2(Fool(AllPeople, x, t2)) ∧ ¬∀x∀t(Fool(x, AllPeople, t))`

---

## ✅ **Answer 4b)**

### 🔹 **Knowledge Representation (KR)** using Propositional Logic:

* Uses **atomic propositions** (e.g., `A`, `B`) to represent knowledge.
* Uses **connectives**: ∧ (AND), ∨ (OR), → (Implies), ¬ (NOT)
* Each fact is a **true/false** statement.

**Example:**
If it is raining, the ground is wet:
`Raining → WetGround`

---

### 🔹 **Comparison:**

| Feature        | Propositional Logic        | Predicate Logic                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Structure      | Atomic sentences           | Includes variables and quantifiers         |
| Expressiveness | Limited (no relationships) | More expressive (can relate entities)      |
| Quantifiers    | ❌ Not supported            | ✅ Supports ∀ (forall), ∃ (exists)          |
| Example        | `A → B`                    | `∀x(Student(x) → Studies(x))`              |
| Use Case       | Simple facts               | Complex knowledge (e.g., family relations) |
