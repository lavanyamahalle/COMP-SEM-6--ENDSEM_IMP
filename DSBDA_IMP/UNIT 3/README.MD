### ✅ **Prompt 8: 9 Smart Universal Points (Scoring Fillers)**

*(Each point naturally includes one or more universal keywords)*

1. **"Data-driven decisions are central to modern businesses."**

   > Adds depth, relevant to any analytics, modeling, or planning question.

2. **"The choice of model depends on the nature of the problem and the data."**

   > Applies to lifecycle, regression, classification, or tool selection.

3. **"Accuracy and performance metrics help evaluate model effectiveness."**

   > Smart way to justify outcomes in modeling or planning phases.

4. **"A clear understanding of stakeholders is crucial during the planning phase."**

   > Adds domain awareness; useful for questions on lifecycle, discovery, BI/DS.

5. **"ETL processes ensure clean and structured data before model building."**

   > Highly reusable filler for questions on tools, preprocessing, or lifecycle.

6. **"Visualization tools like Tableau or Python’s matplotlib help interpret results effectively."**

   > Earns marks even in modeling or data presentation discussions.

7. **"Scalability and data volume influence tool and platform selection."**

   > Great technical insight to use in architecture, big data, lifecycle answers.

8. **"Prediction and insight generation are primary objectives in most analytics projects."**

   > Broad application: regression, clustering, lifecycle, BI vs DS, etc.

9. **"Tools like Python, R, and Hadoop ecosystems are often integrated into analytics pipelines."**

   > Shows technical knowledge; scores points in Q1 or Q2 regardless of exact topic.
