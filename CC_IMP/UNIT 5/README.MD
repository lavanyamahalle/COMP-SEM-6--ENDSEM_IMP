## ✅ **Q5 & Q6 Short Notes (Security + Testing)**

---

### 🔹 **1. Cloud Security Services**

* Protect cloud data, users, apps from threats.
* **Key Services**:

  * **IAM** – control access rights.
  * **Encryption** – data at rest/in transit.
  * **Firewalls & IDS** – monitor/block traffic.
  * **MFA** – adds login security.
  * **Logging & Monitoring** – audit activities.
* **Why Needed?**

  * Prevent data breaches.
  * Ensure compliance (GDPR, HIPAA).
  * Maintain trust & uptime.

---

### 🔹 **2. Risks in Cloud Computing**

* **Common Risks**:

  * **Data Breach** – unauthorized access.
  * **Data Loss** – accidental deletion/hardware failure.
  * **DDoS Attacks** – service unavailability.
  * **Insecure APIs** – backdoor attacks.
  * **Insider Threats** – employees misusing access.
* **Risk Management**:

  * Backups, IAM, firewalls, audits, zero trust policies.

---

### 🔹 **3. CIA Triad (2024 Focus)**

* **Confidentiality** – only authorized access.
* **Integrity** – data remains correct and untampered.
* **Availability** – systems accessible when needed.

---

### 🔹 **4. Secure Cloud Software Testing**

* Ensures apps are **bug-free and secure**.
* **Techniques**:

  * **Penetration Testing** – simulate attacks.
  * **Vulnerability Scanning** – find weak points (OWASP ZAP).
  * **Static/Dynamic Analysis** – code + runtime testing.
  * **Compliance Testing** – meets regulations.

---

### 🔹 **5. Types of Cloud Testing**

| Type              | Purpose                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Functional**    | Ensure features work as expected |
| **Load**          | Handle expected user volume      |
| **Stress**        | Work under extreme load          |
| **Regression**    | New code doesn’t break old code  |
| **Security**      | Check for vulnerabilities        |

* Works even when file is **shared or moved**.
* Often used with **DRM** (Digital Rights Management).
* Ideal for **confidential docs**, **email attachments**.

---

### 🔹 **7. Server-Side vs Client-Side Encryption**

| Feature             | Server-Side                | Client-Side                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Encryption Location | On cloud provider’s server | On user’s device before upload |
| Key Control         | Cloud provider             | User                           |
| Ease of Use         | Easier setup               | More secure, but complex       |
